# Machine Learning Assignments
This repo includes implementation of various machine learning models to predict target variable (continuous/label). The series of assignments are a part of Graduate class of Applied Machine Learning (UTD BUAN 6341). <br/>
* `Assignment 1` – Linear and Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent Algorithm
* `Assignment 2` – Support Vector Classification with Linear, Radial and Polynomial Kernel, Decision Tree Classifier, Pruned Decision Tree Classifier, and AdaBoost Decision Tree Classifier
* `Assignment 3` – k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Artificial Neural Network Classifier
* `Assignment 4` – ANN Classifier run on features  created using 1) clustering algorithms – a)k-Means Clustering and b) Expectation Maximization, 2) feature selection technique using Random Forest Feature Importance and feature transformation techniques - a) Principal Component Analysis, b) Independent Component Analysis, and c) Random Projections, and 3) k-Means Clustering features with features selected using Random Forest Feature Importance and Principal Components

## About Data
